_Prompt example 1: In this unique adventure, you, the AI wizard, guide me as your apprentice through the mystical realms of our fantasy world. As we journey, echoes of King Arthur's legendary tale intertwine with our own, unveiling secrets of magic and valor._  

_Prompt example 2: As the AI game master, you weave an enthralling narrative set against the enigmatic ambiance of the 1950sâ€”a period steeped in secrecy and fascination. In this immersive murder mystery, participants are whisked away to a vintage era of fedoras and seductive femmes fatales, where each lurking shadow harbors a clandestine truth and every hushed exchange unveils a vital clue._
